    <p>After one of the busiest weeks of the year, another jam-packed week awaits investors, with a rush of corporate earnings slated for the first week of November, as just over eight weeks remain in 2025.</p>
    <p>Stocks finished last week on a high note, with earnings out of <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> late Thursday lifting tech stocks into the weekend and capping off a more than <strong>2.5%</strong> gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) last week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) both rose a more modest 1%.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> cut interest rates, as expected, and President Trump's meeting with his Chinese counterpart, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, in South Korea saw trade tensions further ease between the two nations.</p>
    <p>In the week ahead, the AI trade will remain front and center for investors, with <strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong>, <strong>AMD (AMD)</strong>, <strong>Supermicro (SMCI)</strong>, and <strong>Constellation Energy (CEG)</strong> all set to report quarterly results. Dozens of other names in the S&P 500 are also expected to report.</p>
    <p>On the economic data side, the ongoing government shutdown will likely delay the monthly jobs numbers for a second straight month, making Wednesday's private payrolls figures from <strong>ADP</strong> the week's biggest labor market update.</p>
    <p>Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors from the <strong>Institute for Supply Management</strong> and <strong>S&P Global</strong> will be other key highlights, along with a preliminary look at consumer sentiment in November from the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, due out Friday.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Far from it</h1>
    <p>A quarter-point cut was widely expected at the October Fed meeting. But the <em>real fireworks</em>, analysts say, came afterward during <strong>Fed Chair Jay Powell's</strong> press conference, where he said that another cut in December is “not a foregone conclusion, far from it.”</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “The FOMC wasn't as dovish as markets had hoped last night when Jerome Powell poured cold water on those expecting another 25bps cut in December to be a done deal,” said <strong>Capital.com</strong> analyst <strong>Daniela Hathorn</strong>. “The statement knocked some wind out of the risk-on mood in markets.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>She added that the Fed continues to face a “near-total lack of economic data” on which to base its outlook — a factor that adds to market uncertainty heading into the end of the year.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        BNP Paribas analysts “continue to expect ongoing rate cuts, including at the December meeting,” while Bank of America analysts “remain comfortable with our view that the Fed will not cut rates again under Chair Powell.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Though opinions differ, both banks agree that the process is becoming increasingly contentious — a dynamic likely to keep investors on edge as 2025 draws to a close.</p>

        title: 'Where the Nexperia auto‑chip crisis stands now',
        intro: 'The Dutch‑Chinese chipmaker Nexperia is at the centre of a global supply‑chain standoff threatening automotive production across the U.S., EU and Asia.',
        content: `
    <article class="prose max-w-full space-y-6">
    <p>The Netherlands‑based chipmaker Nexperia, long a major supplier of inexpensive but critical automotive semiconductors, has been thrust into a three‑way geopolitical dispute involving the U.S., China and the European Union.</p>
    <p>In late 2025 the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia over concerns that its Chinese owner Wingtech Technologies was transferring intellectual property abroad. China responded by halting exports from Nexperia’s Chinese assembly facility, raising alarms about global car‑production disruption. <em>(Source: public reporting)</em></p>
    <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108220234-17619405512025-10-23t103823z_1905056082_rc2mhhav54c5_rtrmadp_0_volkswagen-production-chips.jpeg?v=1761940606&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Nexperia chip facility" class="w-full rounded-lg my-4"/>
    <p class="text-xs">The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker’s German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Impact on automakers</h2>
    <p>While Nexperia’s chips are not the most advanced, they are used in high volumes in vehicles — for functions such as climate control, locking systems and basic sensors. Automakers warned of production delays if supplies remain constrained.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “The situation could lead to considerable production restrictions in the near future, and possibly even production stoppages,” said VDA, Germany’s automotive association.
    </blockquote>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Potential resolutions</h3>
    <p>Signs have emerged of partial export exemptions from China in an effort to resume chip flows. But industry experts caution that even if shipments restart, qualifying alternate suppliers and rebuilding trust in supply chains will take time.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, the crisis underscored three lessons: (1) the importance of visibility into chip inventories, (2) the need for diversified manufacturing locations, and (3) the value of maintaining buffer stocks in critical industries.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why Nexperia chips are so important</h2>
    <p>Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.</p>
    <p>The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.</p>
    <p>Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year. In late October, automakers such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia’s chip exports are curtailed for long.</p>
    <p>While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Recent developments</h2>
    <p>In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to take control of Nexperia amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.</p>
    <p>Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.</p>
    <p>Signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge. Reports indicate the U.S. plans to allow Nexperia to resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China has said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban, though officials did not specify which products.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,” said The Chinese Commerce Ministry in a statement.

    <p>LendingTree estimates the tariffs will increase holiday costs by a total of $40.6 billion. The average American holiday shopper will pay $132 more because of the tariffs implemented by President Trump, the online lending marketplace estimates.</p>
    <p>“It can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,” said LendingTree’s chief consumer financial analyst.</p>
    <p>American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to LendingTree. Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad “liberation day” tariffs. Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.</p>
    <p>Consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.</p>
    <p>LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season. The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.</p>
    <p>Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion. That translates to around $132 per shopper. Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,” said Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst.
    </blockquote>
    <p>“While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,” Schulz said. “That’s a choice no one wants to have to make.”</p>
    <p>Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs. Schultz agreed, calling it an “unfortunate reality” that many consumers will have to face.</p>
    <p>“That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,” Schulz said. “I doubt that we’ll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they’re what so many people want. However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.”</p>
    <p>LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper. Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said. Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.</p>

        title: 'This startup founder works 11-hour days — but still makes time for family and fitness',
        intro: 'Desmond Lim, CEO of Workstream, shares how he balances long workdays with family time and fitness.',
        content: `
<article class="prose max-w-full space-y-6">
  <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108101112-1739340016688-Workstream_CEO.jpg?v=1739340142&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Founder image" class="w-full rounded-lg my-4"/>
  <p>It’s often said that “there’s no such thing as balance” in entrepreneurship, but startup founder Desmond Lim disagrees. The CEO and co-founder of Workstream, a HR, payroll and hiring platform for hourly workers, says that balance isn’t just possible — it’s also necessary.</p>
  <p>Running a company can be very taxing, said Lim, who works about 11 hours a day on average. Not only are the hours long, but it can also be mentally consuming. “The emotional ups and downs are always very challenging ... The highs are very high, the lows are very low,” said Lim.</p>
  <p>“Every year, you still think the company could die. And then I just try to remind myself ... you are still alive, healthy, everything is good,” he said. “And the other thing is, you cannot stop thinking about work. I dream about it.”</p>
  <p>That’s why Lim believes it’s crucial for entrepreneurs to protect their health and energy. His strategy? Sticking to a fixed daily schedule that works best for his body and brain. “My advice is, find your own rhythm,” the 39-year-old said.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Mixing two kinds of schedules</h2>
  <p>Lim follows what he calls a “dual schedule,” inspired by an essay by Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator. Graham’s essay breaks down two types of time management: a manager’s schedule — typically packed with back-to-back, hour-long meetings — and a maker’s schedule, designed for creators like programmers or writers who thrive working in long, uninterrupted stretches to focus and build.</p>
  <p>“I actually like to have my schedule mixed ... I like to have calls, deep work, calls, deep work,” said Lim. Rather than sticking strictly to one style, Lim said he thrives by mixing both and following his own rhythm.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">A typical weekday</h2>
  <p>6:30 a.m.: Wake up</p>
  <p>7:00 a.m.to 8:30 a.m.: Exercise or sports</p>
  <p>8:30 a.m.to 9:30 a.m.: Protein shake and get ready for work</p>
  <p>9:30 a.m.: Arrive at work</p>
  <p>9:30 a.m.to 10:30 a.m.: Plan out the day and clear some to-do items</p>
  <p>10:30 a.m.to 12:30 p.m.: Meetings</p>
  <p>12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.: Lunch with team</p>
  <p>1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.: More meetings</p>
  <p>2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.: Deep work</p>
  <p>5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.: More meetings (sometimes with people in Asia)</p>
  <p>7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.: Finish up last tasks and work</p>
  <p>8:30 p.m.: Leave office</p>
  <p>On weekends, Lim says he locks away his work phone in a cupboard and focuses on spending time with family.</p>
  <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108217596-1761628442968-Desmond_1.jpg?v=1761628593&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Workout image" class="w-full rounded-lg my-4"/>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Going deep on personal passions</h2>
  <p>Along with saving weekends for family time, Lim also prioritizes his passion for sports and exercise by building it into his daily schedule. “One advice [I have] for founders and leaders is ... to go very deep on one passion you have that is not work [related],” said Lim. “For me, that has been sports ... I do a lot of basketball, swimming, and gym. I think having a balance other than work has been very helpful for me.”</p>
  <p>Lim developed his love for basketball when he was seven. He went on to captain his school teams from middle school to university, and even played professionally for the Singapore National Youth Team.</p>
  <p>These days, he still starts each morning with 75 to 90 minutes of exercise — calisthenics, gym training or basketball — often with a friend to keep him accountable. “I really believe in being able to move well ... [especially] as you grow old,” he said. “I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning. For me, it’s sports.”</p>
