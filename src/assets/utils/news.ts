    <p>After one of the busiest weeks of the year, another jam-packed week awaits investors, with a rush of corporate earnings slated for the first week of November, as just over eight weeks remain in 2025.</p>
    <p>Stocks finished last week on a high note, with earnings out of <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> late Thursday lifting tech stocks into the weekend and capping off a more than <strong>2.5%</strong> gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) last week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) both rose a more modest 1%.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> cut interest rates, as expected, and President Trump's meeting with his Chinese counterpart, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, in South Korea saw trade tensions further ease between the two nations.</p>
    <p>In the week ahead, the AI trade will remain front and center for investors, with <strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong>, <strong>AMD (AMD)</strong>, <strong>Supermicro (SMCI)</strong>, and <strong>Constellation Energy (CEG)</strong> all set to report quarterly results. Dozens of other names in the S&P 500 are also expected to report.</p>
    <p>On the economic data side, the ongoing government shutdown will likely delay the monthly jobs numbers for a second straight month, making Wednesday's private payrolls figures from <strong>ADP</strong> the week's biggest labor market update.</p>
    <p>Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors from the <strong>Institute for Supply Management</strong> and <strong>S&P Global</strong> will be other key highlights, along with a preliminary look at consumer sentiment in November from the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, due out Friday.</p>

        alt="Federal Reserve press conference" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto" />
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Far from it</h1>
    <p>A quarter-point cut was widely expected at the October Fed meeting. But the <em>real fireworks</em>, analysts say, came afterward during <strong>Fed Chair Jay Powell's</strong> press conference, where he said that another cut in December is “not a foregone conclusion, far from it.”</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “The FOMC wasn't as dovish as markets had hoped last night when Jerome Powell poured cold water on those expecting another 25bps cut in December to be a done deal,” said <strong>Capital.com</strong> analyst <strong>Daniela Hathorn</strong>. “The statement knocked some wind out of the risk-on mood in markets.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>She added that the Fed continues to face a “near-total lack of economic data” on which to base its outlook — a factor that adds to market uncertainty heading into the end of the year.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        BNP Paribas analysts “continue to expect ongoing rate cuts, including at the December meeting,” while Bank of America analysts “remain comfortable with our view that the Fed will not cut rates again under Chair Powell.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Though opinions differ, both banks agree that the process is becoming increasingly contentious — a dynamic likely to keep investors on edge as 2025 draws to a close.</p>

        title: 'Where the Nexperia auto‑chip crisis stands now',
        intro: 'The Dutch‑Chinese chipmaker Nexperia is at the centre of a global supply‑chain standoff threatening automotive production across the U.S., EU and Asia.',
        content: `
    <p>The Netherlands‑based chipmaker Nexperia, long a major supplier of inexpensive but critical automotive semiconductors, has been thrust into a three‑way geopolitical dispute involving the U.S., China and the European Union.</p>
    <p>In late 2025 the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia over concerns that its Chinese owner Wingtech Technologies was transferring intellectual property abroad. China responded by halting exports from Nexperia’s Chinese assembly facility, raising alarms about global car‑production disruption. <em>(Source: public reporting)</em></p>
    <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108220234-17619405512025-10-23t103823z_1905056082_rc2mhhav54c5_rtrmadp_0_volkswagen-production-chips.jpeg?v=1761940606&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Nexperia chip facility" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto"/>
    <p class="text-xs">The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker’s German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Impact on automakers</h2>
    <p>While Nexperia’s chips are not the most advanced, they are used in high volumes in vehicles — for functions such as climate control, locking systems and basic sensors. Automakers warned of production delays if supplies remain constrained.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “The situation could lead to considerable production restrictions in the near future, and possibly even production stoppages,” said VDA, Germany’s automotive association.
    </blockquote>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Potential resolutions</h3>
    <p>Signs have emerged of partial export exemptions from China in an effort to resume chip flows. But industry experts caution that even if shipments restart, qualifying alternate suppliers and rebuilding trust in supply chains will take time.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, the crisis underscored three lessons: (1) the importance of visibility into chip inventories, (2) the need for diversified manufacturing locations, and (3) the value of maintaining buffer stocks in critical industries.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why Nexperia chips are so important</h2>
    <p>Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.</p>
    <p>The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.</p>
    <p>Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year. In late October, automakers such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia’s chip exports are curtailed for long.</p>
    <p>While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Recent developments</h2>
    <p>In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to take control of Nexperia amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.</p>
    <p>Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.</p>
    <p>Signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge. Reports indicate the U.S. plans to allow Nexperia to resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China has said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban, though officials did not specify which products.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,” said The Chinese Commerce Ministry in a statement.

    <p>LendingTree estimates the tariffs will increase holiday costs by a total of $40.6 billion. The average American holiday shopper will pay $132 more because of the tariffs implemented by President Trump, the online lending marketplace estimates.</p>
    <p>“It can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,” said LendingTree’s chief consumer financial analyst.</p>
    <p>American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to LendingTree. Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad “liberation day” tariffs. Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.</p>
    <p>Consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.</p>
    <p>LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season. The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.</p>
    <p>Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion. That translates to around $132 per shopper. Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
        “For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,” said Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst.
    </blockquote>
    <p>“While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,” Schulz said. “That’s a choice no one wants to have to make.”</p>
    <p>Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs. Schultz agreed, calling it an “unfortunate reality” that many consumers will have to face.</p>
    <p>“That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,” Schulz said. “I doubt that we’ll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they’re what so many people want. However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.”</p>
    <p>LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper. Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said. Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.</p>

        title: 'This startup founder works 11-hour days — but still makes time for family and fitness',
        intro: 'Desmond Lim, CEO of Workstream, shares how he balances long workdays with family time and fitness.',
        content: `
  <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108101112-1739340016688-Workstream_CEO.jpg?v=1739340142&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Founder image" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto"/>
  <p>It’s often said that “there’s no such thing as balance” in entrepreneurship, but startup founder Desmond Lim disagrees. The CEO and co-founder of Workstream, a HR, payroll and hiring platform for hourly workers, says that balance isn’t just possible — it’s also necessary.</p>
  <p>Running a company can be very taxing, said Lim, who works about 11 hours a day on average. Not only are the hours long, but it can also be mentally consuming. “The emotional ups and downs are always very challenging ... The highs are very high, the lows are very low,” said Lim.</p>
  <p>“Every year, you still think the company could die. And then I just try to remind myself ... you are still alive, healthy, everything is good,” he said. “And the other thing is, you cannot stop thinking about work. I dream about it.”</p>
  <p>That’s why Lim believes it’s crucial for entrepreneurs to protect their health and energy. His strategy? Sticking to a fixed daily schedule that works best for his body and brain. “My advice is, find your own rhythm,” the 39-year-old said.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Mixing two kinds of schedules</h2>
  <p>Lim follows what he calls a “dual schedule,” inspired by an essay by Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator. Graham’s essay breaks down two types of time management: a manager’s schedule — typically packed with back-to-back, hour-long meetings — and a maker’s schedule, designed for creators like programmers or writers who thrive working in long, uninterrupted stretches to focus and build.</p>
  <p>“I actually like to have my schedule mixed ... I like to have calls, deep work, calls, deep work,” said Lim. Rather than sticking strictly to one style, Lim said he thrives by mixing both and following his own rhythm.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">A typical weekday</h2>
  <p>6:30 a.m.: Wake up</p>
  <p>7:00 a.m.to 8:30 a.m.: Exercise or sports</p>
  <p>8:30 a.m.to 9:30 a.m.: Protein shake and get ready for work</p>
  <p>9:30 a.m.: Arrive at work</p>
  <p>9:30 a.m.to 10:30 a.m.: Plan out the day and clear some to-do items</p>
  <p>10:30 a.m.to 12:30 p.m.: Meetings</p>
  <p>12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.: Lunch with team</p>
  <p>1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.: More meetings</p>
  <p>2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.: Deep work</p>
  <p>5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.: More meetings (sometimes with people in Asia)</p>
  <p>7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.: Finish up last tasks and work</p>
  <p>8:30 p.m.: Leave office</p>
  <p>On weekends, Lim says he locks away his work phone in a cupboard and focuses on spending time with family.</p>
  <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108217596-1761628442968-Desmond_1.jpg?v=1761628593&w=1480&h=833&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y" alt="Workout image" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto"/>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Going deep on personal passions</h2>
  <p>Along with saving weekends for family time, Lim also prioritizes his passion for sports and exercise by building it into his daily schedule. “One advice [I have] for founders and leaders is ... to go very deep on one passion you have that is not work [related],” said Lim. “For me, that has been sports ... I do a lot of basketball, swimming, and gym. I think having a balance other than work has been very helpful for me.”</p>
  <p>Lim developed his love for basketball when he was seven. He went on to captain his school teams from middle school to university, and even played professionally for the Singapore National Youth Team.</p>
  <p>These days, he still starts each morning with 75 to 90 minutes of exercise — calisthenics, gym training or basketball — often with a friend to keep him accountable. “I really believe in being able to move well ... [especially] as you grow old,” he said. “I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning. For me, it’s sports.”</p>

        title: 'US economic growth accelerates in third quarter',
        intro: 'The U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending, but momentum appears to have faded ​amid the rising cost of living and recent government shutdown.',
        content: `
        <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CUMhndWBE6RV89esFaEa1Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investopedia_245/4a5bb4d7e2caee5a66eec84f06b69198" alt="U.S. economy image" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto"/>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) — The U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending, but momentum appears to have faded amid the rising cost of living and a recent government shutdown.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product increased at a 4.3% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its initial estimate of third-quarter GDP. The economy grew at a 3.8% pace in the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would rise at a 3.3% pace.</p>
<p>The data was delayed by a 43-day government shutdown, making it somewhat outdated. Consumer spending increased at a 3.5% rate last quarter after advancing at a 2.5% pace in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Much of the acceleration in consumer spending resulted from a rush to buy electric vehicles ahead of the September 30 expiration of tax credits. Motor vehicle sales fell in October and November, while spending in other areas showed mixed results.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Impact of the government shutdown</h2>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the shutdown could shave between 1.0 and 2.0 percentage points off GDP growth in the fourth quarter. While most of the lost output is expected to be recovered, between $7 billion and $14 billion could be permanently lost.</p>
<p>Forecasters believe the economy grew at a solid pace in the third quarter, though the delayed release means the data is becoming stale. A long-postponed GDP report had been expected to show growth of around 3.2%, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The advance estimate, originally scheduled for October, was canceled when workers at the BEA and other agencies were furloughed during the shutdown. The figures released this week will be revised again as additional data becomes available.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Higher-income households doing the heavy lifting</h2>
<p>Surveys suggest consumer spending is being driven primarily by higher-income households, buoyed by a strong stock market that has inflated household wealth. In contrast, middle- and lower-income consumers are struggling with rising living costs caused by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.</p>
<p>Economists describe the divide as a “K-shaped” economy, where wealthier households and large corporations continue to thrive, while others fall behind. Large businesses have largely absorbed higher import costs and continue investing in artificial intelligence, while smaller firms struggle under tariff-related pressures.</p>
<p>Trump’s policies have contributed to what economists call an affordability crisis, weighing on his approval ratings. Households are also facing higher utility bills as rapid growth in AI and cloud computing drives up electricity demand, with some consumers expected to face sharply higher health insurance premiums in 2026.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">What this means for the economy</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve this month cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, but signaled borrowing costs are unlikely to fall further in the near term. Policymakers are waiting for clearer signals from the labor market and inflation data.</p>
<p>While rapid economic growth typically signals rising living standards, recent GDP figures have been distorted by shifts in trade linked to tariffs. Imports subtract from GDP, and a surge in imports earlier this year briefly pushed growth into negative territory before rebounding in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Despite the volatility, economists believe the economy continued expanding in the third quarter, powered by its main engine of growth: consumer spending.</p>

        intro: 'Google (GOOG, GOOGL) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) in the AI race.',

<p>Fast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a “code red” emergency as the company works to match Google’s latest Gemini 3 AI models. The situation marks a notable reversal from 2022, when Google declared its own code red following the release of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Google is also catching up to OpenAI on a key metric: monthly active users (MAU). At the same time, the company is racking up wins on the hardware front, strengthening its position across the AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>In October, Claude developer Anthropic announced it was expanding its use of Google’s AI chips, including plans to deploy up to one million processors to power its models. Google is also reportedly in talks to provide its chips to Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to support its AI products.</p>
<p>All of it added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, positioning Google for continued momentum in the year ahead.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Wall Street turns bullish on Google</h2>
<p>“Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a December 11 investor note.</p>
<p>“Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,” Munster said. “Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI’s, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and Google Cloud Platform continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.”</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Google’s AI wins pile up</h2>
<p>Google counts its AI revenue within its Google Cloud Platform business, and that segment is seeing rapid growth. In the third quarter, Google said GCP revenue climbed 34% year over year to $15.1 billion, following 32% growth in the prior quarter.</p>
<p>The number of new GCP customers jumped 34% during the quarter.</p>
<p>“Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s latest earnings call.</p>
<p>Pichai added that Google signed more deals worth over $1 billion in the third quarter than it had in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of existing cloud customers are now using Google’s AI services.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Gemini 3 shakes up the AI race</h2>
<p>Google has also woven AI more deeply into Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all U.S. users at the Google I/O conference in May and later introducing ads into AI Overviews.</p>
<p>The company found unexpected viral success with its Nano Banana AI image app, which spread rapidly on social media in August. But the biggest splash came in November with the release of Gemini 3.</p>
<p>Gemini 3 drew immediate praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was abandoning ChatGPT after testing Google’s new model.</p>
<p>The release sent shockwaves through the AI industry, knocking GPT-5.1 from the top spot across several performance categories.</p>
<p>According to TD Cowen’s John Blackledge, a survey of about 2,500 U.S. consumers showed Gemini’s MAU penetration growing faster than ChatGPT’s between July and October. Gemini climbed from 24% to 26% during that period, while ChatGPT slipped from 36% to 35%.</p>
<p>Market intelligence firm Sensor Tower found that while both apps are growing globally, Gemini’s MAU rose about 30% between August and December, compared with roughly 15% growth for ChatGPT. Easier access via Android devices and features like Nano Banana helped fuel Gemini’s gains.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Legal battles and other bright spots</h2>
<img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YcZ1ehqVxXbfA6JU4GaoAQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/2c3a83b0-df52-11f0-b5fb-789551ad63f7" alt="Google legal and Waymo image" class="w-3/4 rounded-lg my-4 mx-auto"/>
<p>AI wasn’t Google’s only win in 2025. While the company lost a second antitrust case in April related to online advertising, it avoided harsher penalties in other rulings.</p>
<p>In September, a judge declined to force Google to divest its Chrome browser, despite ruling that the company holds an illegal monopoly in search. The court also allowed Google to continue paying distribution partners for preloading Search, Chrome, and AI products.</p>
<p>That decision enables Google to keep paying Apple an estimated $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on iPhones.</p>
<p>Beyond legal matters, Google made significant progress with Waymo, expanding its autonomous ride-hailing service to cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, while adding freeway driving in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.</p>
<p>The company also unveiled prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset powered by Android XR, a joint platform developed by Google and Samsung.</p>
